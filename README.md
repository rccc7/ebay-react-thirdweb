# EBay-react + ThirdWeb

eBay-like portal. Demo page similar to eBay UI that simulates the purchase and sale procedure but with NFTs instead of items and cryptocurrency instead of money. Users can log in using their Metamask crypto wallet account. Once logged in, the user can start mining ("Add to Inventory" option) and list their NFTs with the options of "Buy Now" or list them as an "Auction". Then users can purchase or bid the listed items.
